# Arachnid
Specification of HTTP transport of NMOS grains over the world-wide-web.

Details to follow.

Arachnid is labelled as Streampunk Media arachnid to make it clear that this is not an AMWA or NMOS RFC or specification at this time. This is intended as an open specification and will be offered to the AMWA as an RFC as soon as it is sufficiently mature.
